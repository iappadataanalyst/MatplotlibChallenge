Observations:
1.	The given data is for preclinical/ laboratory study where mouse were treated with certain drugs that are under development as potential therapeutic agents for cancer.
	There is no patient or human data available, and hence the data itseld could not be called as clinical trial, as mentioned. 
	Clinical trials are the studies conducted on human subjects and not on mice.

2.	Capomulin seems to be efficinet over other drugs used in this animal models. 
	But there were no data available about the safety of the drug, other than survival rate. 
	Most chemotherapeutic drugs are more toxic than their efficay which determines their clinical use.

3.	For mouse or animal studies, untreated controls would better mimic clinical conditions than Placebo, 
	because we never trained the mice psychologically to know that they are getting treatment for cure, 
	(infact it would be additional stress for them which would psychologically promote the cancer)
	and no way we can expect they emntally think that they are getting cured. 
	Most of the times it is the thought process that controll physiologicall activities including activation of immune systen that will cure the disease.
